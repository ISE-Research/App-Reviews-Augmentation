com.owncloud.android,A Google user,"As a total Linux and networking newbie, i was able to get ownCloud up and running along with port forwarding to use the mobile app. Seems to work fine, though i wish there was a filter to display all locally stored files and a way to replace them all with virtual placeholders instead of having to delete each one locally one by one.",0,1

com.owncloud.android,A Google user,Great app when combined with owncloud server running on your own kit at home.\tThere isn't masses of functionality in the app but it does as much as the competitors app. Worth paying this small fee for the app to help fund future development of the app and owncloud server I run on a HP Microserver at home for free. No more having to pay dropbox fees ;-) Photos instantly sync when taken which is all I really required.,0,0

de.danoeh.antennapod,Cedric Edwards,"It used to be the perfect app for me, but now, there are adverts(skippable), and delays loading podcasts. It also point tonGpodder to sync podcasts, but this doesn't seem to work, in that it is not possible to create an account at Gpodder. I would still recommend it over many other, because it has great features. ",1,0
de.danoeh.antennapod,Stuart Black,"I'm very grateful to the developers for creating this app. I would like a podcast selection interface outside of a side menu, but this is just my preference. Already recommended to others who are sick of ads. \xf0\x9f\x91\x8d\xf0\x9f\x8f\xbb",0,1
de.danoeh.antennapod,A Google user,This was a great and simple podcast app. I really liked it. And then it had \nits most recent update and it unsubscribed all my podcasts and deleted all \nmy downloads. Had more than 50 podcast subscriptions and 100 downloads. \nReally bummed I lost all that content. Will not use anymore,1,0
de.danoeh.antennapod,A Google user,Hands down best podcast app. Good design and easy to use.  Does seem to use a fair amount of battery during playback (high media server battery use) but that could probably be fixed with an update to use kitkat's newer audio tunneling feature.,1,0

de.danoeh.antennapod,A Google user,"Absolutely love the minimalist design. It's low resource, doesn't throw ads at you, and the swipe to podcast list is nice.

de.danoeh.antennapod,A Google user,"1) no way to know what you've listened to.       2) no auto delete when you've finished a pod, which is another reason it's hard to know what you've already listened to.       3) very unintuitive. Clicking directly on a cast brings up the show notes of all things. To actually play or delete a file you have to find a little drop down arrow menu. Checking a file as read or unread is extremely erratic. Files are not automatically checked as unread so you have to manually check them.  Then th",0,1

de.danoeh.antennapod,A Google user,I read a review on Antennapod and downloaded it.  I really like it.  Does everything I need.  My wishes are for more ease in finding podcasts and the ability to have multiple play lists. But as a free player is great. I like the new improvements too.,0,1

de.danoeh.antennapod,Y G,May be the best podcast app- but with one major flaw. There is no option of multiple playlists.

de.danoeh.antennapod,Wojciech Zaremba,"Snappy, minimalist, clean UI, amoled dark theme. Convenient rearranging of the playback queue with ""Move to top"" and ""Move to bottom"". Option of having the playback queue on launch. Synchronization via Gpodder (eg with PC). A couple of nitpicks: (1.) import/export should be a top-level settings category or merged with ""Synchronization""; (2.) I\'d love to have a ""stop after current"" option in the ""Sleep timer""; (3.) a bottom toolbar would be nice - instead of having to open the navigation drawer.",0,1
de.danoeh.antennapod,Matthew Squires,"Great, but it would be nice if it used the Podcasts directory that comes with Android (or they would allow users to choose that directory!!) ""Storage/emulated/0/Android/data/de.danoeh.antennapod/files/"" is one of the most inconvenient locations imaginable, especially when ""Podcasts"" is sitting there *empty* in the root folder. Also, it would be great if it functioned as an mp3 player as well, the capability is already built in there and it would save users from having multiple similar apps.",0,1

The only thing for me missing is an EQ. I find podcasts a bit ""boomy"" on the car stereo over Bluetooth, compared to say streaming Spotify music, so I like the bass turned down.
