### **Description**

Describe the component. Example: What is it and what is it meant to be used for?
For more context, it is recommended to reference a Figma link or post a screenshot of the component in this section.
Example Screenshot:
![Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200.png)

### **Technical Details**

Unless audited by Design System - Place component in `components-temp` directory location in `app/component-library/components-temp` directory.

- Component Structure (Assume `NAME` = your component's name)

  - Under `NAME` directory
    - [ ] `NAME`.tsx - Actual component file.
    - [ ] `NAME`.types.ts - Includes all TypeScript related types/interfaces/enums etc.
    - [ ] `NAME`.styles.ts - Includes styles for the `NAME` component.
    - [ ] `NAME`.test.tsx - Includes both snapshots AND unit tests.
    - [ ] `NAME`.stories.ts - Includes stories for the `NAME` component.
    - [ ] `NAME`.constants.ts - Includes any constants that is used in any `NAME` file. For example, test IDs for tests, mappings for the component, etc.
    - [ ] `NAME`.utils.ts - Includes any utility functions specific to be used with the `NAME` component.
    - [ ] index.ts - Exports both `NAME` component as default and anything else such as types, test IDs, etc if needed.
    - [ ] README.md - Documentation on how the `NAME` component will be used and the props associated with it.

- Caveat
  - Components may differ in terms of files to include depending on what is needed.
  - For example - you might not need a constants file or a styles file depending on how the component is built.
  - A more specific example - you can omit the styles file if your component doesn't require styles. Just use your best judgement.
- Refer to an example component such as `AvatarFavicon` for more details.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- [ ] Snapshot and unit tests pass
- [ ] Storybook shows interactive version of component. Include screenshot or video in pull request for visual reference.
- [ ] Component structure should resemble the structure listed in the Technical Details section above.

### **References**

- References go here.
- Figma links.
- Slack threads.

# *STOP RIGHT THERE!*

Issues are ***NOT*** for getting help, only for reporting bugs and feature requests.

Search open and closed issues to see if your question already has an answer. However, **do not create a new issue.**

Instead, do the following:

1. Download the [Example App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xxmassdeveloper.mpchartexample) and check out the [source code](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/tree/master/MPChartExample/src/com/xxmassdeveloper/mpchartexample). 90% of the time there is an example that does exactly what you are trying to do.

1. Look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki) for the official documentation for MPAndroidChart. You can also browse the [javadoc](https://jitpack.io/com/github/philjay/mpandroidchart/v3.1.0-alpha/javadoc/) for a more detailed tutorial of the API.

1. Go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mpandroidchart) and ask your questions there. The community will be much more helpful and willing to offer guidance.


### You have been warned!

        When reporting on issues with unexpected output, it is very helpful to include the exact sequence of keys, the output expected, and the output received, for example:

        ```
        Typed: <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>b</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>
        Received: ""abc""
        Expected: ""abC""
        ```

        It's optional to use `<kbd></kbd>` to get key icons in the keying sequence, but it does add clarity; alternatively, do something like this:

        ```
        Typed: a b shift+C
        ```

        Tip: use key names such as `spacebar` rather than just a space!

**Use Case**
- Describe the motivation to add this new feature and which problems it will tackle.

> It would be nice to have a helper method in the adapter to notify that the visibility of the header of a section was changed.
> It's known that this can be done with the native notifyItemInserted and notifyItemRemoved methods but it would be nice to have the logic to calculate the header position wrapped in a method of the adapter.

**Design**
- Which methods will be created/modified/deleted in the existing classes.
- Which classes will be created/deleted.
- Explanation for each of the changes listed above.

> Create methods:
>
> - notifyHeaderInsertedInSection
>
> Get position with getHeaderPositionInAdapter and call callSuperNotifyItemInserted
>
> - notifyHeaderRemovedInSection
>
> Get position with getSectionPosition and call callSuperNotifyItemInserted

**How to use**
How the developers will use the new methods/classes introduced by these changes.
> Simply call:

> adapter.notifyHeaderInsertedInSection(section);

Thanks for letting us know!

If you have more than one thing to report for a card, please put them all in one issue, rather than opening multiple issues at once.

Tip: When reporting incorrect information, you'll need to enable ""show raw station and route IDs"" in Metrodroid's ""Developer options"" screen to always show IDs, even if the station is known.

Tip: if you want to send a pull request instead, take a look at the ""data"" directory in Metrodroid's source code.

(Please delete this line and above before submitting.)

## Required information

- Name of the card:
- Name of the transit agency:
- Location:
- Metrodroid version:

For each thing, we'll need:

- Type: (line, station, route, agency)
- Mode of transport: (bus, train, metro, tram, ferry, funicular)
- The raw ID, as it shows in Metrodroid:
- The name of the station, stop, route or line:

## New card checklist

- [ ] I have read and acknowledged the New cards wiki page.
- [ ] I can provide dumps, transaction history, and balance records for more than one card from the operator.
- [ ] I have attempted to understand the card format on my own.
- [ ] I have provided notes on what I've found so far.

### Please answer all questions listed here:

- Name of the card:

Is there any publicly accessible documentation for this card format?  If so, provide links:

Is there an official app for using the card?

What are the system and service codes on the card?  (eg: System 0x3 services: 0x1, 0x2)

You've selected ""unknown media"". You can find out what media your card uses from the ""Advanced Info"" screen in Metrodroid.

Without knowing what the media is, you probably don't have enough information to help us.

If there's more than one type of media used by an agency, then pick whatever card is more common (unless it is fully locked).

Please read the guidelines for new quest suggestions before posting one:

### General
Affected tag(s) to be modified/added: [](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:)
Question asked: **Is there an example tag on item XY?**

<!-- If the answer is not obvious, please add a short explanation below each item. -->
### Checklist
Checklist for quest suggestions (see [guidelines](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete/blob/master/QUEST_GUIDELINES.md)):
- [ ] 🚧 To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose
- [ ] 🤔 Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging (Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one)
- [ ] 🐿️ Easily answerable by any pedestrian from the outside but a survey is necessary
- [ ] 💤 Not an overwhelming percentage of quests have the same answer (No spam)
- [ ] 🕓 Applies to a reasonable number of map data (Worth the effort)

<!--
All of the above should be fulfilled. 
If you are not sure about how one condition applies to your suggestion or you have (very) strong reasons that a condition may not needed to be satisfied in your case, just note that down. Someone else may come up with some ideas.
-->

### Ideas for implementation

<!-- If you have any idea for how elements should be selected, add it here. -->
**Element selection:** 

<!-- If you have any idea whether metadata per country is needed, add it here. If you know where to get this data from, mention it here too -->
**Metadata needed:** 

<!-- If you have any idea on how the UI (the form appearing when the quest is asked) should look like.
You can use any way to propose a UI. Feel free to include a mockup. 
Do include all answer possibilities you consider for that quest. -->
